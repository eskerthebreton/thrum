## Character Attributes

The numerical description of a character's general physical and mental capacities is encoded as in many other games via _attributes_. There are three **general** attributes: **Physique (PHY)**, **Sensorimotor (SEN)** and **Cognition (COG)**, each of which is subdivded into two **specific** attributes, one more proactive and one more reactive or passive. Physique is divided into **Might (MIG)** and **Endurance (END)**, Sensorimotor into **Finesse (FIN)** and **Reflex (REF)**, and Cognition into **Reasoning (REA)** and **Focus (FOC)**. Each of these general and specific attributes are described next.

### Physique (PHY)

A catch-all for the elements of physical and athletic prowess pertaining to the exertion of and resistance to force.

#### Might (MIG)

The active/offensive component of Physique, describing a character's ability to apply physical force. The primary attribute for most forms of melee combat, as well as feats of athleticism and physical prowess out of combat.

#### Endurance (END)

The passive/defensive component of Physique, describing a character's ability to resist or withstand physical assault, whether external (such as from an attacker) or internal (such as from toxins). The governing attribute to resist dropping from exhaustion and avoid physical damage, and the secondary attribute for unarmed combat and archery, as well as the construction of physical objects both on a large and small scale.

### Sensorimotor (SEN)

The overall characterization of a character's ability to connect physically with the world

#### Finesse (FIN)

The active/offensive sub-attribute of nimbleness describing a character's capacity for fine motor control and precise movement and hand-eye coordination. The primary ability for ranged combat and ninjutsu, of stealth, and of crafting requiring fine-motor skill.

#### Reflex (REF)

The passive/defensive sub-attribute of nimbleness describing a character's ability to instinctively react to physical threats, potentially avoiding harm. Governs the ability to avoid damage entirely from physical attacks, the secondary attribute for bladecraft and ninjutsu, as well as feats of athleticism and stealth.

### Cognition (COG)

The mental faculty concerned with processing of information.

#### Reasoning (REA)

The ability to synthesize information and predict the consequences of actions. Governs the ability to nudge systems, whether physical or mental, to produce a desired effect. This includes both mundane attempts to influence people or find solutions to problems, as well as magical attempts to manipulate matter or the mind.

#### Focus (FOC)

The force of a character's mental resolve. The primary attribute governing one's ability to resist mental manipulation or fatigue. The secondary attribute for the magical disciplines concerned with energy and souls, and of the non-combat disciplines of reconnaissance and problem solving.

## Attributes and Arts

The special actions characters take during play are organized into **combat arts** for use during violent conflict, and **utility arts**, used the rest of the time. Both combat and utility arts are cateogorized by **disciplines**, each of which is linked to a primary attribute, which is one of the three active specific attributes, and a secondary character attribute, one of the three reactive/passive specific attributes. A character's facility with arts in each discipline is influenced by both of its corresponding attributes, though the active attribute has a greater influence.

## The Fundamental Dice Mechanic

Most rolls consist of a contest between an active and reactive participant, though at times the reactive participant is the world itself. Each participant rolls **2d6** and adds an appropriate modifier, which may be associated with a combat or utility art, or simply with an attribute. Defenders often have more than one option for the attribute or ability they roll, with different consequences depending on the choice made. For instance, a Basic Attack can be contested either with **Resilience** (using **END**) or **Evasion** (using **REF**), with different results depending on which defensive attribute is chosen. Ties always go to the defender.

### Criticals

Some abilities specify an additional effect that occurs on a **Critical**. These effects occur when the character using the ability rolls 5 or more above the opposing roll.

### Triggered Effects

In some cases, an ability may list a **Trigger**. In these cases any effect listed after the trigger occurs only when the triggering condition is satisfied. In the event multiple characters have effects triggered by a common trigger, they resolve in initiative order (from the top of the order down). If an effect is triggered by the effect of another triggered effect, they resolve in **last-in-first-out** order (i.e., as a "stack"). In other words, triggered effects preempt the remaining resolution of any abilities that create their trigger.

### Banes and Boons

Equipment and situational factors can confer **Boons** or impose **Banes** on the roll of the attacker or defender. Each Bane cancels one Boon and vice versa. For each net Boon or Bane an additional d6 is rolled. For each net Boon, the lowest d6 result is dropped, and for each net Bane the highest is dropped. For instance, if a roll has two Boons and one Bane, the bane cancels with one of the Boons, leaving one net Boon. So a total of 3d6 would be rolled, with the lowest result dropped, and the remaining two results added together with the modifier to obtain the result. So if the outcomes were 3,4,6, the 3 would be dropped and the 4 and 6 added, leaving a total (before the modifier) of 10.

## Combat

### The Grid, Movement, and Targeting

Combat takes place on a grid consisting of squares. 

#### Movement

Movement is measured in **squares**, and orthogonal and diagonal steps count the same (1 square each).

#### Range 

A square counts as **adjacent** to another square if it is one step away (i.e., each square has 8 adjacent squares surrouding it). Additional squares adjacent to an adjacent square are at  and so on. The distance between two squares is equal to the movement that would be needed to travel from one square to the other when moving unhampered. This produces a simple rule: The disttance between any two squares is always the longer of the two of the horizontal and vertical separation between them: if a square is 7 squares to the "west" and 4 squares to the "north", it is 7 squares away, because the shortest path to it requires 7 steps. A target is valid for an ability with Range X if the distance between them is X or less.

#### Areas of Effect

When something targets an area, its area of effect is either listed as **Area X** or as an **Aura X** (where X is an integer). An **Area X** consists of a square on the grid which is X unit squares on a side. So, an Area 2 is a 2x2 square, Area 3 is a 3x3, and so on. The area must have at least one of its spaces within the range of the ability that places it.

An **Aura X** area consists of all squares at a distance X or less from the ability user and remains centered on the target even if they move. So, an Aura 1 effect impacts a 3x3 square centered on the source, an Aura 2 effect impacts a 5x5 square, etc.

#### Terrain Effects and Buffs

Some abilities create **Terrain Effects**, which are areas that exert an ongoing influence on characters in or passing through them but do not directly target characters. A particular character can only have one Terrain Effect in place at a time: if they create a new one any previously placed Terrain Effects disappear.

Other abilities are tagged as **Buffs**. These generally target the ability user themselves or an allied character and persist until the end of combat unless they specify a condition under which they end sooner. A particular character can have any number of buffs created by their abilities active at a time, but a particular target can benefit from only one at a time. If a target who is already benefitting from a Buff effect is targeted by another one, they may choose whether to end the previous one or decline the new one.

### Rounds, Turns and Actions

Combat is divided into **Rounds**, in which each character (PC and NPC) participating in the combat (that round) takes a **Turn**. When a combatant enters the fight, they make a REF roll (rolling 2d6 and adding their REF modifier). This total determines their **Initiative**. 

Turns within a round take place in descending order of initiative. This order remains the same round after round unless a character elects to **Delay** their turn. A player (or the GM) can choose to delay acting in a round until a specified point in the initiative order. If they do, their turns take place at that later position for the rest of the combat. This can only be done once per round, so if for instance Bob rolled the highest initiative total, and elects to delay their turn until after Alice, Alice could choose in turn to delay her turn until after Bob, but at that point Bob would have to act (he cannot delay again).

At the start of combat a special **Round Zero** occurs, in which characters take no actions, but on their turn can position themselves within the **Deployment Zone** designated by the GM, and enter a **Stance** (see Action Economy).

#### Action Economy

On a normal turn (i.e., after the setup round), a character can **Move**, **Act**, and take a **Stance**, in that order. Once a character stops moving to take an action, they cannot continue moving afterwards unless their action tells them they can. Following the resolution of their action, they can choose to remain in their current stance or switch to a different one. All characters have access to several **Basic Actions** and **Basic Stances**, in addition to those granted by abilities they choose during character creation and leveling up.

### Incapacity and Death

Unlike in many other games, characters do not have hit points (or a health pool). Instead, when a foe is successful in hitting them with an attack, offensive spell, or similar, the target often receives a point of either **Fatigue** or **Stress**. Whenever Fatigue or Stress is added, the GM rolls 2d6, adding the total points of Fatigue or Stress carried by the character (including the new source). If the total exceeds (not ties) the character's corresponding **Tolerance**, they are **Incapacitated (Fatigue)** or **Incapacitated (Stress)** and cannot move, act, or take stances until they are no longer Incapacitated.

Upon becoming Incapacitated, and at the end of each of their turns while Incapacitated, a character's corresponding Tolerance score (Fatigue or Stress depending on which was the source of the incapacity) is reduced by 1 as is their points of Fatigue or Stress. If either of a character's tolerance scores ever reaches zero, they die. 

Incapacity ends if the corresponding load score (Fatigue/Stress) is reduced to zero, at the end of combat, if another character targets them with the **Resuscitate** action, or another ability is used that ends Incapacitated.

Although current Fatigue and Stress are relatively easy to reduce, diminished Tolerance scores can only be restored by an extended period convalescence or by powerful magic.

### Physical and Mental Attacks

When a character is targeted by an ability with the Attack type, they always have the chance to defend themselves using either a standard defensive roll (their choice of **Resilience** or **Evasion** for Physical Attacks, or **Resolve** for Mental Attacks), or an ability that provides an alternative defensive option. This is the only time characters act outside their turn, unless their current stance has a **Triggered Effect** that can occur outside their turn.

### Standard Defensive Rolls

When a character is targeted by a Physical Attack they may choose to defend using their choice of **Resilience** or **Evasion**, but must choose which to use before the offensive roll is made. This choice involves tradeoffs, with Evasion presenting a binary contrast between success and failure, while choosing Resilience provides for a range of outcomes including mitigated success and mitigated failure.

When targeted by a Mental Attack, **Resolve** is the standard defense.

#### Evasion 

Evasion rolls use your **REF** modifier. Evasion is all or nothing: a successful roll avoids the effect entirely, whereas a failed roll results in taking the full effect. 

#### Resilience

Resilience uses your **END** modifier. In contrast to Evasion, Resilience has a gradation of outcomes: 

* **Critical**: Avoid the effects
* **Success**: Take Fatigue (but no more than one point) but skip the roll to become **Incapacitated**
* **Failure**: Take Fatigue, but unless the roll against you is a Critical, delay the incapacity roll until the end of your next turn

#### Resolve

Resolve rolls use your **FOC** modifier. Unless the offensive ability specifies otherwise, the outcome is simply success or failure, similar to Evasion for Physical attacks.

## Character Creation

Players begin with a pool of 1 General Attribute points, 2 Specific Atribute points, 3 Combat Arts points and 3 Utility Arts points. 

### Allocating General Attributes

First, General Attribute points are used to raise Physique (PHY), Sensorimotor (SEN) and/or Cognition (COG), which in turn raise their corresponding subattributes. For example, assigning +1 to PHY would raise one's modifiers for Might (MIG) and Endurance (END), and assigning +1 to SEN would raise Finesse (FIN) and Reflex (REF).

### Allocating Specific Attributes

Next, Specific Attribute points are used to further raise individual subattributes: **Might (MIG)**, **Endurance (END)**, **Finesse (FIN)**, **Reflex (REF)**, **Reasoning (REA)** and **Focus (FOC)**. These are added to any points these attributes inherit from their generic attribute. So, having assigned +1 to **PHY** in the previous step and to **MIG** and **REF** here would result in a +2 modifier for **MIG** (since it falls under **PHY** and was also raised directly), +1 for **REF** (which was raised directly) and **END** (which benefits indirectly from PHY but wasn't raised directly) and +0 to FIN (neither raised directly or indirectly).

### Allocating Arts Points

Combat Arts points are allocated similarly. The overall modifer for combat arts consists of three components: the number of points directly allocated to it, the full modifier of its primary attribute, and half of the modifier (rounded down) of its secondary attribute. 

Following the example character above who raised **PHY**, **MIG** and **REF**, suppose they also allocated +1 to **Bladecraft** and +2 to **Kineticism**. This would produce a **Bladecraft** modifier of +3: +1 from the point to **Bladecraft**, +2 from the **MIG** modifier, and none from **REF** since half of +1 rounded down is 0. The **Kineticism** modifier would be +2 from the direct allocation but it does not benefit from attribute modifiers since **REA** was not raised and **REF** is not yet high enough to contribute as a secondary attribute. They would also have a +2 modifier for **Unarmed** and **Animism** even though these weren't invested in explicitly, due to the **MIG** modifier.

The same process is followed for Utility Arts, with the modifier consisting of direct allocation, the full primary attribute modifier and half the secondary modifier (rounded down).

### Defensive Modifiers and Tolerance

Defensive modifiers are not added to directly, but are directly inherited from one of the three "passive" attributes (**END**, **REF**, and **FOC**).

The END and FOC modifiers also determine a character's **Fatigue Tolerance** and **Stress Tolerance** respectively (see Incapacity and Death), which start out equal to 10 plus the corresponding modifier. There is no corresponding tolerance score related to Reflex; instead, Reflex contributes to reaction time via **Initiative** (see Rounds, Turns and Actions).

### Speed

All characters start with a Speed of 4, though some abilities may modify this.

### Ability Selection

Finally, abilities associated with Combat Arts and Utility Arts are selected. The number of abilities selected across all Combat Arts is equal to the direct point investment in Combat Arts, and similarly for Utility Arts. This number starts at 3 and increases as characters level up. These picks can be distributed across any Arts in which at least 1 point has been invested. So, the example character who put +1 in **Bladecraft** and +2 in **Kineticism** would choose three abilities split any way they choose between Bladecraft and Kineticism. Some abilities can be upgraded by foregoing the selection of a different ability in that discipline. These abilities refer to [Tier] in their description. When initially selected abilities have a Tier equal to 1. Each upgrade increases their Tier by 1. 

### Leveling Up

Characters can raise modifiers and gain and upgrade abilities as they level up, per the following table. Whenever the table indicates +1 to an Art, both a Combat Art and a Utility Art are raised. Moreoever, whenever a character gains a direct bonus to a Combat Art or Utility Art, they also select a new combat or utility ability, respectively (it does not have to come from discipline that was raised). At any given level a character has an accumulated number of ability picks (and/or ability upgrades) for each of combat and utility, as specified by the table. 


Level | Gained                     | Cumulative Ability Picks (Each Type)  
------|----------------------------|------------------------------------  
   1  | (see Character Creation)   |          3  
   2  | +1 to an Art               |          4  
   3  | +1 to a Specific Attribute |          4  
   4  | +1 to an Art               |          5  
   5  | +1 to a General Attribute  |          5  
   6  | +1 to an Art               |          6  
   7  | +1 to a Specific Attribute |          6  
   8  | +1 to an Art               |          7  
   9  | +1 to a General Attribute  |          7  
  10  | +1 to an Art               |          8  
  11  | +1 to a Specific Attribute |          8  
  12  | +1 to an Art               |          9

## Statuses, Buffs and Other Conditions

### Statuses

Some statuses have a parameter X. When a character is affected by one of these statuses, reduce X by 1 at the end of each of their turns after any other "end of turn" effects resolve. 
If X is reduced to 0 the status ends.

**Immobilized:** Affected character cannot move except via teleportation or being moved by another effect.

**Slowed X:** Affected character has -2 Speed and cannot take stances.

**Bleed X:** At the start of the affected character's turn, they must roll against their fatigue tolerance as if taking damage. On a fail they are Incapacitated.

**Dazed X:** Target suffers **+1 Bane** on all defensive rolls.

**Burning:** The affected character takes **Fatigue** at the end of their turn. They may choose to forego their normal **Move** or take the **Recover** action to end the status.

**Blinded X:** Abilities used by the affected character have their range halved (rounded up) and attacks targeting enemies in nonadjacent spaces are at **+1 Bane**.

**Disoriented:** When the affected character tries to move to an adjacent space, they must roll 2d6. On a result of 7 they move as intended and this effect ends. If the result is greater than 7, count a number of spaces clockwise from their starting position equal to the difference starting with the intended destination. They move instead to the resulting space. If the result is less than 7, instead proceed counterclockwise.

**Stunned:** The affected character can Move or Act on their turn, but not both. At the end of their turn, this effect ends.

### Buffs

**Hidden:** Abilities targeting the affected character have their range halved (rounded up) and abilities targeting them from nonadjacent spaces are at **+1 Bane**. The condition ends if the affected character targets an enemy with any ability or is targeted by an enemy from an ajdacent space.

**Hastened:** Affected character has +2 Speed and **+1 Boon** on **REF** rolls
